Brief
Your challenge is to build out this landing page from the designs provided in the starter code.

Download the starter code and go through the README file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts etc.

Keep your code as clean as possible. Be sure to use semantic HTML5 markup and reusable CSS classes.

Stay away from using front-end frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and Bulma. Treat this as your practice ground for building a web page from the ground up.
